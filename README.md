# Online-Bookstore-Application-Test
The Right Bookstore India is a simple Online Bookstore application that allows users to browse and purchase books. The application is built using Java and Spring Boot for the backend, and React for the frontend. My goal is to perform thorough testing to ensure the application's functionality, security, and usability.
